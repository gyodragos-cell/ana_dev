Sync status: public GitHub release and Mother Lab both contain the lightweight
resource system. Mother Lab kept its private workspace data untouched.

Dashboard-facing labels were moved into resource text keys. Test results are recorded in the final agent report.

Test results:
- Public `python -m compileall -q main.py core tools vscode_extension`: OK.
- Public `python main.py --test`: 3 PASS / 0 FAIL.
- Public `python main.py --list-tools`: 80 tools available.
- Public `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 87 tests OK.
- Mother Lab `python -m compileall -q main.py core tools vscode_extension`: reported `Can't list 'vscode_extension'` because that folder is absent.
- Mother Lab `python main.py --test`: 2 PASS / 0 FAIL.
- Mother Lab `python main.py --list-tools`: 74 tools available.
- Mother Lab `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: not a valid local suite run because Mother Lab has no local `tests/` folder; Python discovered installed `site-packages` tests from `objection`, which failed on external package permission errors.

Audit results:
- Dashboard-facing v20 section labels, status labels, and error strings moved into resource text keys.
- Dashboard colors are read from `load_theme(...)`.
- Loader uses Python standard library only and keeps safe fallbacks.

v21 foundations added:
- Theme switching hook with `ANA_THEME`.
- Resource-only dev-mode hook with `ANA_DEV_MODE`.
- Resource Inspector, Dashboard v2, and Tool Health Visualizer placeholders.
